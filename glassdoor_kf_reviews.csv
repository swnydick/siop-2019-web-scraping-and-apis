Do not care about their employees in the slightest. You are a body in a seat, nothing more. I could argue you are less than that. Managers are hardly present, so employees go weeks (even MONTHS seriously) without showing up to work with no repercussion. Do you think this motivates employees to work hard? Me neither.2. If you have career goals, this is not the place for you. Cheap company. Takes advantage of new grads - offers average/below average salaries, see they are hungry to succeed, give them more responsibilities and work, and refuse to give any type of bonus or promotion. Work harder, longer hours with no incentive. For at least 2 years.3. Training is almost embarrassing. Either long and excessive or there isn't any. They train you on things that are common sense (my group was scolded for falling asleep during training several times). We were a group of young, intelligent employees - never once did they stop and think their content was irrelevant. Once we were actually assigned our real life work, we were swimming with the sharks with no direction. But thank goodness I knew the definition of integrity!4. Business model. There is no doubt in my mind that the executives at this company are brilliant, hard working people. That is what inspired me. I quickly realized that the executives would have little influence to me as a recruiter. What matters is management - and boy do they need help. Executives know the company and they know how to sell our business. They can SELL. The problem is they are so disconnected from the actual recruiters that they oversell and we cannot deliver. What does this mean for you as a recruiter? It means unreasonable goals and expectations and it means very unpleasant relationships with the client. Enjoy!5. The energy in this office is pitiful. Everyone is unhappy with the company, but they are afraid to speak up because of the risk of losing their job. That in itself should tell you something. No room for career movement. If you are unhappy, suck it up or leave the company. You are disposable.6. I even had issues after leaving the company. When trying to get into contact with the benefits department, I was transferred 4 TIMES in one call and then sent to voicemail. When I called back twice, no one could help me so the woman took down my information to have someone call me back. No one ever called me back. Talk about unprofessional.Since leaving this company, I have been so much happier. I have more energy. I feel more calm. I get better sleep. Please think twice before accepting a position here.","Listen to your employees. Support them. Build a professional relationship with them. Care about their success or lack there of."

I've received multiple promotions and pay raises and on that front I have no complaints. If you are proactive about your own development I think there are good opportunities at Korn Ferry to broaden your skill set and get exposed to challenging assignments/roles. However I will be leaving the firm soon due to my many frustrations with how the firm is run and how the broader employee population is treated.","Hard to trust management - lack of transparency.Pay is not in line with market, even though Pay & Rewards is one of the firm's main competencies.Managers are not provided with any real training on how to be effective, despite Leadership Development being one of our supposed competencies. I have been in a management/leadership role for 3.5 years and have not received a single hour of mgmt. training.The firm is extremely numbers driven and is still run with an old-school Search mentality. If you are coming from another search firm it will probably feel similar. However if you are on the Advisory/Products side of the organization you may not like the button-up, stiff culture that continues to permeate the organization.Merit increases are discretionary, 401k matches (very small) are discretionary, annual bonuses are discretionary. Basically everything is discretionary. The firm will not make commitments to employees regarding some of these pieces.Morale is low in many parts of the business, turnover is high and the firm doesn't seem to really care.Finance runs this firm. For a People/Talent advisory firm, the internal Talent/HR team has absolutely zero power. That has presented serious issues on multiple fronts.","Take better care of your employees. They should not be treated like cogs in a wheel. If you invest in them adequately they will be far more likely to remain with the firm and strive for exceptional client service.Show yourselves as human beings.

Huge, long run potential in becoming a human capital giant if they can improve their own talent management and optimize execution. Office closure from Christmas to the New Year.","Attrition is high and morale low. On the associate level, much of this is due to lack of transparency and consistency in how RAs and Associates are hired, promoted, and compensated. Some RAs/Associates have moved up quickly by being opportunistic and learning when there is a vacancy for an upward move while others who are less politically inclined go through a lengthy, promotion process typically after 2 yrs. Actual experience level, performance, and annual reviews therefore seem to hold little weight. Also lack of standardization in resources, e.g., some RAs have laptops, others don’t. Pay is not competive. Your day-to-day and overall experience is highly dependent on what team and partner(s) you work for. Some partners are great, others not so much but either can't save you from the corporate bureaucracy and otherwise nonexistent culture.","If a spot is open on a team, open the position to all those are qualified so that those interested have a chance at pursuing the opportunity.

They will either say it wasn't a good year to give you a small bonus regardless of the doubled up stock price or rob people completely off their bonus and start a stream of lay offs claiming positions are no longer required. For corporate functions, this happens towards the end of the year right before you will earn your bonus, so they'll make sure to get the biggest advantage then can of people and have them do all the hard work before they will let them go, more like free of charge work. And when they do, they will prevent any current employee from providing any external reference for any other current or former employee. Just to be clear, do not think about this twice, you're stepping into a TRAP.Very highly political work environment that your direct boss won't find as shame to steal your effort and claim it all to themselves and show off your unnoticeable errors as a big deal so you will never promote. People who play more politics will get annual or biannual promotions regardless of their performance.Executives will accept and ask for gifts and some of them will discriminate between people based on who paid their duties.Depends on who you are trying to work with, most of the corporate executives are sick. Don't let them fool you, they do not look for strong talents, THAT'S A LIE, they're looking for obedience and never talent. They will hire very poor inexperienced people on executive positions to secure their obedience. If you think you're strong enough, don't bury yourself here, you'll be very intimidating to your superiors and they will make sure to demotivate you.Very abusive and unsupervised culture, if you speak up, you're out and they will make sure to make it the most brutal way.Executive management will listen to and spread rumors about their employees.No career development programs in place and no flexibility to allow you to enroll into one by yourself.Old-school culture and a boy's club, there's a limit on progression for people from certain races, origins, religious beliefs and ideologies.Passive HR function, they will hear to employees problems and frustrations and never take any action.Lack of support from the leadership team, regardless of how many times you reach out for help or how significant the issue you're trying to bring to their attention is. Its more of a war to get a higher bonus at year end by eliminating others.Leadership is unable to deal with the company's growth, they only try to please the investors and will do whatever it takes to get a penny increase in the earnings per share regardless of how it could negatively impact future periods. No long term vision in place. A company that size can not be just managed as a start up.","You have no asset to protect but people. Management should work on assuring people loyalty and work harder to set the tone at the top. Stock prices might be going up now but if you continue to look down on people and undervalue talents, your success will be only a short term one. PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH.Respect laws instead of bending them and be honest to your people.Make some investment in your corporate team, though they do not generate revenues but they support all your functions.Change your HR with more active people who would give a damn about your company, at least you wouldn't end up with piles of lawsuits against you from your own people."

I was not fired and left on my own terms. I found a better job paying way more than Futurestep would ever pay me. If you're looking for income based on experience and to be paid what you're worth then keep looking. The pay is low compared to other companies in the industry. This is also not Korn/Ferry which is very unfortunate. There are recruiters, recruiting coordinators, talent acquisition specialists, sourcing specialists and search associates. You work on projects as a team or independently. The management team is horrible. They will speak down to you and will be rude. They play favorites and talk behind employees backs and laugh at them in their offices. They are not available because their doors are always closed. If your a favorite brownnoser then you can get their time and spend hours behind closed doors with them. If you have questions then you just have to wait or find someone else to ask. This makes it difficult when a team lead has been fired and you have noone to go to and are constantly told to ask your pm. Certain employees will report back to management anything they say or hear just to get ahead. If I am working on a project I do not need another talent acquisition specialist bossing me around and trying to make me look bad so they can look good to management. I had employees talk down to me and be so aggressive that I no longer could deal with it. My ideas were stolen and believed to be theirs. This is not someone that you put in any kind of lead role. What's awful is that this employee wasn't even in a lead role or a management role. They just thought they were and management created a monster and continues to let them act like a monster. I got tired of never getting any recognition or attention for any of my hard work. Too much moving around from project to project and being treated like dirt by other employees that wanted to get ahead at the expense of others. The environment is no better than kindergarten. I was able to move into a better situation and be appreciated while earning great money which I deserve. I have an actual job that is drama free and work with people that want to help and see me succeed and not fail. I wish I had learned more at Futurestep but it is a time that I regret spending","Think about how you look to everyone else. Lead by example and treat all employees as equal. Do not allow a few people to poison a work experience for all the rest. If Futurestep was a great place to work then why do people keep leaving. Good people like myself have left because of all the same issues. Offer better opportunities to advance or let employees grow in the company. Aggresive demanding and bossy people have no place acting as management when they're not. Employees don't respect these types of people and it causes bad feelings.

"1.0","""Low Integrity""","Current Employee - PRI","","2014-08-22","I have been working at Korn Ferry full-time (More than a year)","Doesn't RecommendPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEO","Brand recognitionClient accessPotentialThere are like most professional services firms many remarkable and take Ted people who work there","The firm has branded itself as a talent management consultancy (see website)The firm is a search firm that has broadened its product portfolio with a series of acquisitions including PDI, Global Novations, Lominger and FutureStep among others.The vast majority of the Leadership and Talent Consulting practice revenue is driven by product related sales - mostly assessment (PDI) competency related (Lominger) and training (Global Novations)The professionals coming from these acquired companies are highly educated and talented. They are equally limited in their experience with broader talent consulting let alone organization development experience or qualifications.The marketing department is way out ahead of the groups actual capability touting the firm as the new kid in townThe leaders in charge of building a broader capability come from these product based companies as well and have not built a practice of this scale so it's really a messThey are very good at recruiting you in emphasizing the opp to build the practice but you should ask about the following:Governance - the CFO controls the practice and demonstrates a lack of experience building a consultancy. Remember that's in addition to being a public company.Partnership - being a partner is a title only. The partners do not work together to build the practice, develop its people or define the practice's future.Access to opportunities - even if you bring relationships you cannot avoid working with the mostly narrowly experienced people from the acquired organizations they have assigned as industry or client leads. These people tend to sell what they are familiar with and be threatened by new people with broader capability. There are few exceptions to this and considering all the search relationships very little green field to build a book of business. The search partner thing is what you would expect - highly variable 're understanding talent and preparing for a meeting with their clients can be a time consuming nightmare.Sales target - Principles and Partners have a sales target of up to 2M/year which at first seems easy until you realize there is absolutely no leverage - few to no consultants to help unless you are selling products where you sell, others deliver and yet another group manages the project. They have lifted and installed the model from PDI. So you need to sell 2M per year, if so make a maybe 100k bonus on top of your 240k base and remember you deliver most of the work. If you are a product pusher and that turns your crank you are in much better shape. The system forces you to sell product - assessments, competency models, training rograms - you get the drill (2014 bonuses paid in June 2014 far below 100k target. I sold 1.8, delivered 90 percent of the work and got 30k and a promotion - huh?)Integrity is the most significant issue - the firm literally does not use its own tools. There is no formal onboarding, almost all training is overview of product and how to sell it, hierarchal performance management, no assessment of leaders ( hardest one to stomach as they are literally impacting the careers of 1000s of professionals as they report assessment results to executives, CEOs and Board. Really concerning)If you are considering this firm because of its potential that makes sense. If you think you can join as a new person and affect change against these practices brought by the acquired organizations and entrenched by the appointment of them at every point of market access and leadership - your mom is right, you really are amazing.","Hire McKinsey, BCG or Deloitte and conduct a thorough assessment of the businessHave the Board pay the bill because The CEO needs to listen and hear the results - not sure if he's cut out to do this stage if t be org but not for me to sayTranslate the business assessment results to leader success profiles just like you do for your clientsAssess current leaders against profiles using your assessment tools including 360 feedbackGet the right leaders in the right roles, transition finance from running the practice to a support role to track lag indicators and hold your leadership team accountable to grow the practice through project delivery, client growth and building a pipeline of next generation talentPhysician heal thyself"

Nor did decision to eliminate all bonus payouts, regardless of employment contract agreements with the company. Of course, CEO failed to mention he would continue to take his $500k annual bonus (thank you SEC filings for this). Many Project Managers have little experience in managing projects or clients, which leads to constant issues. Furthermore when projects hit a bump in the road, they offer no strategic insight to move forward. They simple demand you complete the agreed upon contract with no offer of a solution.

They're hiring new people on good salaries but are doing nothing for existing employees. I have people reporting to me who earn more than me. They overload you with work and scratch their heads when you fail. Some managers have no ability to push for a raise for you because they'll lose their own political capital if they do. They have no problem with threatening to fire you if you speak out. They rely on their brand to attract new joiners when the existing employees get annoyed after 18 months. When people leave, they hire someone new and the cycle restarts - it's literally part of their strategy: ""we can get plenty more where you came from."" They do nothing to retain good talent.

One raise in 4 years despite being promised each year. I must really enjoy self-harm to be there for so long. No training programmes or focus on quality - just on the job training by giving you way to many projects. No opportunities for real promotion.

"1.0","""Dangerous, Illegal and offensive place of ""business"" - Manchester TDC""","Current Employee - Recruiter","Manchester, England (UK)","2018-08-14","I have been working at Korn Ferry full-time (More than a year)","Doesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEO","Korn Ferry is a horrible place to work, it markets itself as a leading corporate egalitarian place to work. In Reality, Its nothing like it at all. The only positives are some of the people themselves on the whole. They make the job fun, they are honest and caring and empathetic and share much of this warped environment and at least can rely on each other.","This detailed review is a combination of Several Ex/current employees experiences in the TDC(Talent Delivery Centre) in Manchester over 18 months.• The first negative many see on arrival, is the poor set up and poor training and onboarding. Many people reported of not having a laptop and/or a phone for several weeks.• We have seen recruiter's receive all sorts of abuse from colleagues in Manchester and London with no action done, rather it was kept quiet and away from the likes of the relevant managers and other London based Manager's. These include: - Casual racism, death threats, threats of violence, casual homophobia and misogyny• One of the longstanding internal recruiters has been known to have given some verbal abuse and bullied one other long-standing recruiter•The slow realisation that the money is what keeps the Recruiters there as there is no progression unless you are a love interest or a mate of one of the manager's.This has been known wide spread in Manchester and it’s become a running theme of conversation in London and Manchester• The other managers are known for their surly behaviour, false promises and a complete apathetic view towards escalating these issues to protect their backsides.• The Managers who manage the Recruiters on various accounts have been known to be so abusive that some recruiters have been that distressed they have had to be pulled off the account. The Internal Korn Ferry Managers managing the recruiters on their accounts are uninterested, treat you like a commodity and ask you to help them with their projects but they take all the credit. The communication is terrible between managers and recruiters. Sometime waiting several days before that happens. Progression plans are non-existent and many recruiters cannot see an end game.• Many false promises are made. Many competent Recruiters and Graduates have been promised new accounts and graduates have been in tears because the move never came into fruition. Recruiters have been promised by internal managers that they will be allocated to a new account and other senior recruiters have been begged to come onto a new account under a new manager, but those promises are never delivered due to the sign off not being with them and the manager having no real power or influence.• The Place has grown so much over the last year it has changed the whole ethos and dynamic/working relationship of the recruiters. Many who were friends now don’t see their colleagues and the environment has turned into a call centre where all the great work that is done in Manchester is not acknowledged and in effect the building has become a chicken factory. Many are unhappy that this has now become their work life of no progression and no appreciation.• There are Recruiters there that are on hugely inflated salaries and are either never in the office due to “sickness” or are scraping by on an account which doesn’t seem to care what the quality of work is. One recruiter was in a situation where he had his work load cut about 75% for no reason at all for 6 months and essentially had no work to do. Again managers didn’t react. Seened uninterested in resolving this which showed how they as usual don't care the funnelling away of their clients money for full time recruiters.• One Recruiter had to leave without notice even though he was verbally promised an extension on his contract and his weeks’ notice was not given. There was a lot of contract and minor illegality I'm sure.• Another competent recruiter was mysteriously asked to leave the business immediately after we were told he just wasn't needed. We found out the official ""Manchester managers"" story for his manager cronies was that the recruiter was“underperforming” . The recruiter was never made but made clear of what the reasons were nor was there any evidence of agreed development plans, KPIs or disciplinary procedures. if that was the case of dismissal, I'm sure contractually that should have been another minor illegality. It now appears that one of the managers who removed the recruiter, was not wanting their own manager to be told about the wrong doings and issues this recruiter had on the account and other false promises just to protect himself from any questions or actions. The discussion was not brought up with any other managers also and it seems it was done quietly.• The calibre and expectations of the clients are sometime so ridiculous and untenable that the recruiters can’t enjoy their work because of sometimes strict and ever-changing policies.• A leading figure visited us recently and when several of us asked questions about the future and maintaining the “vision” and they struggled and couldn’t answer basic questions or tip-toed round them like a politician. They were asked about Growth, Brexit, Hay Group/Futurestep.• Several recruiters and two managers also left a major account due to the problems and constant firefighting and changes that they had enforced on them from bizzare policies. The time spent on many of the accounts was short because of this reason.","Too little too late. The bosses have been informed of some of these on going problems. Many hasnt reached them Im sure. You all need to speak to the employees who are ACTUALLY making you money. They are trapped with no guidance, told to not talk about it further and essentially silenced. The good recruiters make Korn Ferry in Manchester's TDC, the management and lack of empathy, progression given and dis-honest promotions make Korn Ferry a place run by narcissists"

People genuinely wanted to solve client problems and have an impact.","Micromanagement by Korn Ferry Corporate Set Up in USANo understanding of how consulting works by some in the corporate set upUnauthentic, self centred leadersCountry leaders are not empowered to take any meaningful decisionsCompliance driven cultureKorn Ferry has been trying very hard to run Consulting as a Search business. Though there are synergies between the two, they clearly have their intentions set on using that to gain short term wins over the potential of long term capability and sustainability of the business. It feels like that most senior leaders confuse action with results and feverishly try to do one thing after other, even when the evidence indicates that it doesn’t work. The morale is an all time low due to sudden change in the way people are treated. Country leadership is capable but has no real empowerment to make decisions. The leadership in the corporate office is largely self centred, selfish and is focused on collecting people at Senior Levels from multiple other organisations with one directive: SELL. This of course has had an impact on the way people feel aboutA) working with others in the company. So collaboration is low because everyone wants to make their numbersB) culture of the firm to an extent that there is no one culture because all the senior partners coming in from different firms are trying to create a mini sub culture of their own.I guess joining Korn Ferry Hay Group is still okay if you are a salesperson and are joining as Associate/Senior Client Partner. I would hesitate to recommend the firm as an employer for anyone coming in below Senior Principal. Some reasons being that Delivery work does not get much respect and there are no base pay raises. With large number of Senior Client Partners joining, the bonuses this year were pathetic as well. On top, because the whole process is centralised in LA, people who got promoted did not know their new salaries till 3-4 months later after starting to work in their new roles. The performance management process is a sham and line managers are powerless and mute spectators with no voice on what rating one will eventually receive. Overall in reward and performance management they do everything that a competent Hay Group Consultant would never advise their clients to do.Another aspect of top leadership is that most senior leaders see their roles as that of police. Sending compliance emails is all one would hear from most of them. In this respect, I gotta say that they run a tight ship. Hopefully this helps them fund their own bonuses at the expense of people delivering and supporting the work.","To start with, the country leaderships need more autonomy and authority to make decisions.Also, professional services firms take pride in their unique culture and career paths. Both of these need to be established in spirit (on paper this exists) with a common baseline culture which is so hard with New Partners joining the firm from every conceivable consulting and non consulting organisation every single week. Also the leaders need to take a broader view of the organisation and not focus on their own well being above everyone else."

Hopefully the new leader from KF in the UK will be able to undo a lot of the damage that the former HG UK leadership team have done over the last year or so but it will be a real uphill battle.

In the UK just stop with the in-fighting and self-promotion, get rid of the previous leadership team and start again with new people! There are still some good people in the business - you just need to re-engage with them and give them the opportunity to help you rebuild and they will be so grateful for a fresh start under new leadership locally that it will have a great impact!! Having said that, there is still a lot of deadwood in the UK and 'one trick ponies' in consulting (particularly in talent/ leadership dev/ assessment) who have been protected by the leadership team through personal friendships but they need to up their games significantly or go. Currently, there is a talent exodus underway in the UK with those who are able to find new roles elsewhere doing so and many more people with CVs in the market looking to leave.

The tool box of Korn/Ferry is incredibly rich and all solutions are connected. Having worked before for a traditional old boys network search firm, I am excited about being able to tap into experts all over the world for talent solutions. It is not always perfect, but I have the opportunity myself to be part of the solution and building of the Firm’s offering. I feel that by embracing the full suite of solutions and embracing colleagues in all lines of business as my colleagues my work has become much richer than before. If I treat executive search as the last cold drink in the dessert, I would die of thirst. The KF solutions are a bottling plant in the dessert and give me a constant supply of things I can talk to my clients about.","Challenges in change time require tough decisions, sometimes I get frustrated why the Firm is so nice to blocking staff for so long, if they don’t support the change they should at least not stand in the way. Difficulty seems that the functional team supporting processes and systems and HR is very thin, they are well aligned with the management and they have built a very tight informal network across the globe to implement things but the network has also day jobs too, so change is sometimes slow or sporadic which makes the field impatient.","I would suggest that the leaders in the company really should try to embrace the word “together” and align themselves more and share then much more what they are doing to bring the company forward. There is definitely a need to be more transparent why things are happening or why things are not happening. If the company does not communicate around these things and does not share its thinking, it looks as if there is not even a consciousness about a certain issue or need. The company values are clear and all that is being done in terms of management and leadership is aligned with that, but we have possibly not enough visibility to connect strategy to management decision to effective day to day work."
