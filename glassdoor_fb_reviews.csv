"5.0","""Fast paced company with high expectations, but incredibly fair. You won't a place that cares more about it's people.""","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee","Menlo Park, CA","2017-02-16","I have been working at Facebook full-time (More than a year)","RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEO","- Incredible benefits- Excellent compensation that rewards strong performance- Lots of autonomy- Tons of room for growth- Very transparent from the top down- Strong leadership- Intelligent and caring colleagues- The most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere- Exciting work","- If you don't learn to make the work life balance work for you, it can be exhausting. But you'll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it.- It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, chances are you're going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better. Imposter syndrome is real, but if you got an offer, you probably belong here too.","Keep doing what you're doing, keep an eye on employee burnout, keep supporting your people and keep pushing them, and the rest of the world, forward."
"5.0","""Pleasantly Surprised""","Current Employee - Site Selection Program Manager","Menlo Park, CA","2016-02-16","","RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEO","I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters. Walking the talk is the best evidence there is."

The company works hard to look after its employees and provide them the best benefits and services. I have yet to see any layoffs. Even when jobs are eliminated Facebook provides assistance to find another position within the company. This is very different from my experience with Coca-Cola and CNN, both of which had regular large scale layoffs. Compensation is very good, especially for engineers. But It can be difficult to get an interview without an internal connection/referral.","I have had 6 managers in 3 years. Facebook has a lot of reorgs. And I am certain all of this change has hindered my career growth. Even though I have received top reviews I have not been able to achieve a promotion.Regarding the culture -- Generally everyone is great to work with and good at their job. However, there are a some people who seem unfamiliar with a professional work environment. These people can cause lots of drama and generally seem ungrateful for the tremendous opportunity we have at Facebook.It can be difficult to deal with all the attacks on the company from the press. When you see so many amazing people working hard to get things right, and the press only focuses on (predominately false) negative articles, it is hard not to get discouraged.","Be better advocates for your top performing employees.

It sets you up for success in a variety of places.","- While compensation is rewarded, leveling up and moving into new roles is very very challenging- Can feel like Facebook values outside hires more than inside talent already there- Many people do not get hired for roles in different departments or functions simply because they didn't do well on an interview, when they are more than qualified based on previous work experience at the company -- which isn't taken into account for hiring decisions. They weight internal/external folks the same.- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product.- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much.- Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams.","- Allow internal candidates some advantages to changing roles or functions within reason -- we have the data and performance history to make the right decision.- Management needs more accountability. Anytime a project didn't ship or a team didn't do well, the leadership had a tendency to deflect blame on PMs, EMs and other ICs rather than leadership. In almost every org, there are major leadership problems that stem from some politics coming into play and people trying to carve out their fiefdom."
"3.0","""A great place to learn and grow, if you're lucky and find the right team""","Former Employee - Product Designer","New York, NY","2019-02-12","I worked at Facebook full-time (More than 3 years)","Doesn't RecommendPositive OutlookDisapproves of CEO","- If you find the right team, and you have the autonomy to self-improve and grow, Facebook is a great place for you to flex your wings, experiment, and improve.- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface â it was lead by a product designer â and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.","Facebook's culture will never change. The recent Q4 earnings are a testament to how good the ""ship fast"" machine is printing money. Even a disastrous 3 year long anti-FB PR cycle didn't keep the stock down for long, which means the company won't make major changes to the way they work.Here are the more radical ideas that will never be implemented:- Zuck needs to go, or step back into a different role to just focus on his pet projects (which he has many). His low EQ trickles down through the company because all important projects live or die by the ""Zuck Review"", which he offers his gut views on the product. The man is not infallible, and cannot predict bad human behavior because he himself (and those around him) are only human, and have many flaws and oversights due to their background, location, wealth, etc.- Build more ""local"" product teams. FB to this day insists on running product from HQ, whereas Lays and Doritos know that their American flavors will never work in Southeast Asia and create local flavors with a local team and local testing. Line is a Korean company that has a Thailand specific team to work on Thailand specific features. Facebook has never done this except for a ""project Japan"" to make FB more appealing to Japanese people in the late 2000s/early 2010s.- Fire a ton of people. There is a lot of incompetence, especially at the management levelNone of that will happen."

There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.- The culture in some organization is toxic â people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance.

Facebook rates tenure over experience, so if you come in with ten years of senior industry experience, but someone has been in a junior role at FB for four years, that junior personâs feedback will be seen as more valuable than the dozens of thanks or recognition you receive cross functionally from other peers.Black employees at Facebook are constantly treated as being less-than.

Facebook is an amazing place to work and, despite the very public screw-ups / media firestorm of late, it's immensely enjoyable to work here. We're encouraged to be ourselves, there's no micromanagement, I feel like I'm free to fly as high as I want, they teach us how to have tough conversations, the management team is surprisingly open and forthcoming, the work is fulfilling and important and broadly impactful, the benefits are never-ending (as is the food supply), there's on-site everythingâ from haircuts to physical therapy to dental care, my coworkers are brilliant and outgoing and very much Type A, work-life balance is incredible compared to the start-up world, and that's just scratching the surface. It's a little shocking how great of a place to work Facebook is.","With 2.1 billion + users comes immense responsibility that it seems the management team was not fully unprepared to handle (see: Russian election meddling, fake/misleading news, Rohinga genocide in Myanmar, data breaches left and right, etc.).

That said, there's concerted, coordinated effort here to right the ship and get out ahead of these issues in the present and the future.","Prove that what you said when you were young and naive about growth and domination(!) at all costs is no longer the prime, sole focus of the company.

Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. Seriously, it's called skype, people.5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaninglessif it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.build a real team structure, and provide some actual leadership.focus on programming for real reasons.

This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisionsâunpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the âFacebook 15â is real). The companyâs health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling- competitiveness and lack of collaboration- relationships hold more value than quality workFacebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes whatâs really going on under the surface. People act like itâs all sunshine and roses, but because thereâs such a âfocus on impactâ and performance, itâs actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibilityâat Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers.As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though youâre told to âbe your authentic selfâ, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, donât rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.While the actual benefits and perks are great, donât be fooled by the glamour of it all: theyâre also designed to keep you there and keep you working. Youâll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes itâs easy to forget to take care of yourself. Thereâs an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If youâre a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesnât matter how much experience or expertise you haveâI spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing.Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, âNope!â Time and again, when Iâd go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, âThatâs the one!â After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, âIâm tired of (and better than) this.â","You hire people for their expertise, so let the use it. And when people bother to speak up, listen. Stop ignoring the problems and waiting for those people to burn out and quit. The number of people who go on medical leave is a signal.

As an individual contributor myself, I really appreciate having a caring and at the same time professional manager, who gives me a lot of flexibility, but steps in when I need them.- You are being recognized for impact, not for how many years of experience you bring to the table. This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced.- You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people.- Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you.- There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs.- You are being ""punished"" with certain benefits if both spouses work for Facebook.

They do not value technical expertise as much as loyalty and subordination. This is a brutal world (remember: criminal gang!) where people are punished frequently for unrelated reason and for no reason whatsoever, and always kept under pressure, sense of fear and uncertainty.The most disgusting thing is lies. Management lies through their teeth, about everything! They create alternate reality, to justify everything they do.They do stack ranking: 15-18% is targeted not to meet their expectations) - they lie that they do not do that. Compared to Amazon which targets 5%, this is horrible.At lower levels (IC3-IC4) they have up-or-out: either you get promoted or you get fired. IC5 level is considered (which is a lie) to be ""very very senior leadership"". When you look at the distribution, more than a half of engineers are IC5+. Given the fact that IC4s are expected to perform consistently at IC5 level in order to be promoted (so they are effectively IC5's), we get a whopping 85% employees being ""senior leadership"" - it's disgustingly evil. It results in the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced in my career.Facebook operates in a ""burn-out mode"": they hire fresh meat, squeeze every drop of juice out of them by overworking, then fire them when they are exhausted. Their model of employment is not sustainable by definition (and is implemented via stack ranking, as well as other tools).Employees are held at a constant state of stress. I've seen employees crying in the office, in front of management.Management mastered an art of vague flip-flopping: no consistency, no responsibility whatsoever.Top management supports this authoritarian criminal pyramid: nobody got fired as a result of recent scandals of data leaks, top VPs were only moved around. Scandal was covered with lies.The hyped-up parental leave is only a PR stunt and a lie: for taking it one gets performance review downgraded.Endless semi-mandatory hackathons to further drain your energy. Oh, there is also a measure of counting ""thanks"" you got during last half a year. If you don't get enough thanks, that's an excuse to downgrade your performance. I say ""excuse"", because there is a huge leeway for a manager to justify any rating at PSC. All performance manager's feedback is vague and non-actionable.Very few people take vacations, due to peer pressure and fear.Everybody whom I talked to were stressed and unsure if they would be employed in 6 months.I wonder where they manage to hire such a low-integrity people. Especially HR: they are the kind of people who just wait for their despot to come to power when they gladly start sending people to Gulags. There is nothing humane about these atrocious individuals.Facebook lies about supporting freedom of speech. In fact, internally you can get easily fired over saying something quite benign. People complain a LOT to management and HR - for minute reasons. A lot of tell-tales for which they occasionally fire without explanations.Finally, Facebook's business practices are quite questionable at best.Among ICs they foster the culture of subordination, impostor syndrome. I guess this makes sense, because this is the only way to cope with Dunning Krueger management.","You should go to prison. All of you. You've done enough damage to this country and the world."

There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team. The values the company promotes are great in theory, but I don't see them in practice.","Promote middle managers internally - the more you bring external hires in, the more the company culture erodes, as these external people are stuck in their ways and not willing to do things the Facebook way, and the way ICs are told to expect things in bootcamp creating a total misalignment between expectations and reality. Also, when you know someone is a bad manager, remove them for the situation instead of allowing them to continue to lead their team astray or throw their ICs under the bus. After all, managers have the ability to have more positive or negative impact than an IC, but they have multiple safety nets built around them to protect them whereas ICs are on their own. Lastly when employees indicate they're interested in moving teams don't ask them to weather the storm for another 6 months in hopes that the next manager will make things calmer - listen to what they are experiencing that's making them want to switch teams and have a more appropriate work/life balance and a better experience with their manager."

"5.0","""Open, fast, no bs""","Former Employee - Software Development Engineer","Seattle, WA","2014-03-17","I worked at Facebook full-time (More than a year)","RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEO","It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc.This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.","You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow. I think this could be really tough."

The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown.* You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features.* The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers.* Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming.* Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year.* Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics.* Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful.* Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.","* Pay close attention to teams that have poor retention and take drastic measures to reverse the vicious cycle (the less seniority on a team, the faster the turnover rate becomes)* I think there is a gap between what's best for the company and what is rewarded in performance reviews. Fixing performance reviews (starting with incentivizing mentorship & collaborative behavior) will likely fix many of the current problems at Facebook."

I don't regret joining FB:- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what.- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude.I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.","Most brutally, to many of the leaders in Ads and elsewhere: Your job is to set strategy and standards, ask aggressive and important questions in reviews, debug high-level problems before they hit the front page of the NYTimes, and find the right resources for your teams. It's not to write leadership manifestos about how to feel inspired. People will upvote soft memos when they're posted, and there's a growing culture that feels they have to to be on your good side. Fight that temptation and show that intellectual rigor and shipping impact, not pandering, still holds the day.In so far as your job is to lead culture, it's also to build a culture that values people for their experiences *before* Facebook. In a company growing this fast and hiring at the middle, not just the bottom, we will have to agree that outside experience matters, or new employees will waste months if not years earning their stripes to prove their code and analysis and strategy and diffs are credible, too. And while there is onboarding time for everyone, this period is navigated alone here much more than it is in hierarchical organizations with mentors/mentees, year cohorts, other structures to force learning, and this lack will be more and more unsustainable as hiring accelerates over the next years."

I've never been one for loyalty to my job or my company, but at least in Social VR, my team are some of the most genuinely supportive and caring people I've ever met in my life and I really feel like they accept me and will be there for me both when I need things at work and when I'm having personal difficulties. I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away. If you prefer to be in an urban center, you should either consider a different location, or a different company.","Honestly just keep doing what you're doing. You're making a lot of great decisions and supporting me in the best way I can imagine."
"5.0","""Best Large Tech Company Culture""","Current Employee - Software Engineer","Menlo Park, CA","2017-12-05","I have been working at Facebook full-time (Less than a year)","RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEO","From the start, Facebook has been amazing.Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!Here's just a sample from today! I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk.Breakfast:Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.Lunch:Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea.Dinner (today was Jamaican themed):Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa.I also got a slice of cheese pizza :)Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust.By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress.The offices are crowded due to how fast we are growing. They are building a few new huge buildings but until those finish things are quite cramped, and the work place can get loud.Also not enough space in the gyms because of the general overcrowding on campus.","As we grow bigger, invest in making sure execution pace is still fast and we don't get bogged down in bureaucracy like other tech giants. Put extra effort to make sure our current culture stays the way it is even as things scale."

I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before.

It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some. The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for.I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be. From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate. When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime. Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken. Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be. They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement. If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts. From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company.One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company. There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me.I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time. In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while. If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer. You'll be happy that you made the decision.","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB. There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do.Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work. This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it. Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work. I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company.","More work needs to be done re: PSCs. There has recently been a statement made about how PSC should not only focus on short term work but also reward long-term work. I would like to see that implemented and encouraged at a granular level. Managers should be trained to encourage long-term projects and reward employees when ambitious checkpoints are hit."

I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people.

I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better.- Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :)- Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally- Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager.- As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles- Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices.","As Facebook grows and continues to invest in hiring, finding people with prior management experience will be key to retaining and developing talent."

Everyone goes above and beyond to help each other to succeed. It truly is a team effort.Upon arriving to the office every morning, everyone from the reception staff to your team says hello to you, and genuinely is interested in your life. People love coming to work every morning and are excited about what they do here every day, and it shows.Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook. However, they also encourage a healthy work/ life balance, ensuring their employees are taking enough time off (either by working reasonable hours every day, and/or actually using all of their PTO) to be able to stay fresh and ready to work when at work.","Not many cons to the company.

The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now. Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.Facebook has my people, my culture. We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense. Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.I'm in the culture fit. Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.I'm in my mid-40s.

That means you don't need to know what you enjoy working on before you join and you can't get stuck with a bad manager.3) New York-specific: the company is in East Village, which means you can live in the most exciting part of the city AND have the luxury of walking to work.4) I think Facebook's company history is interesting.5) Facebook's language infrastructure is phenomenal. Its PHP and Javascript is type-checked, which makes it so much easier to read without typeof checks everywhere.","1) New York-specific: There's about 15 different engineering teams to choose from, which can be a deal breaker if your heart is already set on a particular team we don't have.",""

There is generally a high degree of trust between employees.","- The open floor plan can be completely draining (especially for introverts, like myself).- Very unclear career growth. I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all.- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time.- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging.- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome.- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup.- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company.- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling.- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly.- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating.- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise).- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.- A combination of unclear expectations and high manager turnover led to not-stellar performance reviews for me.- People always said I could work on what interested me and what I was good at but whenever I tried to do so, I was shut down.",""

The company cares a lot about having its employees being productive and satisfied with their jobs and it works hard at maintaining an environment to support that. As a survivor from the real world, this is really rare -- pretty much every company-wide system is designed to make life easier for employees. The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.Many decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged. This can get really annoying at times.Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader. He makes mistakes, but does learn from them. He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far. You will learn a lot if you seek out opportunities to learn, and work with a lot of very talented people. You have to own this yourself, though; don't count on a lot of support.","Facebook still believes that it is a magical meritocracy reasonably free from corporate nonsense. While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other. If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, and then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was. You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them. It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both. Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks. It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore. You will get used to this. ""Move fast and break things"" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company. Have big goals but chop them up into small tasks with well-defined success indicators and communicate them early and often.","To the director- and VP-level people that have been at FB a long time: it's not the same company you went to work at lo those many years ago. There are between 5 and 50 times more employees now, way more products, and way more moving parts. If you want Facebook to stay Facebook-y, invest in the culture that you love. Teach people how to be successful and reward individuals that focus on impact that makes everyone's work easier and the product better, not on whatever new hotness made a contrived graph go in the right direction. Lots of things aren't working right anymore and it is up to you to start the hard conversations about which sacred cows can't provide enough milk for tens of thousands of employees because you never taught the new people how to talk about that stuff."

The reasons are:1. The real impactAt Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.2. The organizational structureGoogle's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style.

Too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses, in hopes of becoming well-rounded. This is fine, but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths, where employees do more of what they're good at, and less of what they're not good at, in a diverse team. I've never seen this done as well as at Facebook.- Moving fast at scale. There are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast, as fast as any startup, that's it awesome. So impressive at Facebook's scale.- World-class team. I know this is said often and loses meaning, but it's true here. Every single person is both smart and nice, a rare combination.- They care about the right things, and don't care about the wrong things. Both parts of this are important. Too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn't matter, e.g. who's invited to a meeting or whatever. At Facebook, everyone is just trying to make a positive impact, without care for politics etc.","- Things change fast. If you're not at ease with change, or if you're seeking a place that never changes, this is not the right company for you. This includes projects, tools, technologies, teams...- There are multiple technical ways of doing most things. It's not always clear which is the best way, so you have to ask people.

The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there. Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around. Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now. We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company. We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value. Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives. That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up. You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas. The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice. It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent. There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform. There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas. We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before. Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences.",""

Culture and work/life balance opportunities). The management team looks down on everyone. No one can advance beyond an entry level position. You get an idea that gets bought or get stuck in an entry level type job for your ""career"" with barely above avg pay rates. I know that this is a competitive industry but sometimes the stupid people win just because they have the right connection. Bad employees stay while realistic workers realize the mistreatment and all leave within a year. I'm not making this up. Go look up Facebook's overall turnover ratio and tell me how that could lead to happy employees. Every SINGLE person on my initial project was lied to about their working hours (expect 9-5 and told 9-5 then made work overnight/graveyard shifts), benefits (only get to go on campus when with a supervisor), and team management.

Mark's Townhall meetings grew out of the weekly Q&A that he runs internally. If you want to ask Mark Zuckerburg or Sheryl Sandberg a question you can do it. If you want to give feedback or see changes in nearly any aspect of Facebook you will be empowered to do it.Your team will likely be comprised of industry experts in your particular area of work. From kernel hackers, PhD's in computer learning, hardware engineers building drones and our own servers, to network engineers that are helping write drafts and RFC's that define the underlying protocol architecture of the Internet - you will find everything under the sun and these people will make you so much better at what you do.If you aren't enjoying what you're doing in your current role you can go on a Hack-a-month with another team. This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!The management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.Also, the benefits are pretty amazing.","Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.The company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, ""always working."" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.The other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook. We won't make counteroffers to keep people, but we'll pay them what they wanted before they left to come back which sets a bad precedent for the people who stay.","Keep doing what you are doing."

How am I here? How does this company exist?"" Facebook is the epitome of the perfect company. A wise man once told me about the four Ps of the perfect employment: Product, Problem, People, Profit.Is the Product interesting? This product serves over 1.5 billion people - it is the most exciting product to be part of.Is the Problem interesting? Beyond interesting. We're trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication, through sharing, through education, etc... In any area of the company, the problems are all great problems to solve.What about the People? The people are literally the best people I've ever worked with in any position I've been through. They are brilliant, kind, friendly and completely supportive. I left my last company as a senior member and at Facebook, I still feel like I'm learning something new from my colleagues every single day. Beyond my colleagues, the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual's career growth to help us grow deep within our roles, support groups to help you become a better manager, classes to help individuals transition from one career to another. I've seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths (e.g. Designer to Engineer, Researcher to Designer, Designer to PM, etc). You pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be.So what about Profit? Facebook, luckily, is doing very well in this area. At a personal level, Facebook pays also very well. I was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to Facebook a no brainer.Take a great product, great people, amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow. That is what Facebook is and I hope it never changes.

College new hires come from top ones: Stanford/MIT/CIT and things.- Good amount of people here are both smart and diligent, you have many to learn from.- Although coworkers are competitive here, they are much nicer to work with than other companies holding same 'elite principals'. For example, I rarely see (though there're few) arrogant people here. The whole culture was built in the sense to favor people who are both smart and humble.- Culture encourages transparency, so you have to learn hear and accept sometimes very tough feedbacks, but you could end up growing much faster as you can tell.- If you are good, there's no barrier on 'what you can do'. Facebook does NOT reveal your level to anyone else except your report. So you could see E3 engineers work like E4 or even E5 in the end. But in another way around, it could be tough for seniors.- Facebook sees deliveries (executions) as 1st priority, so people here just focus on work more than the rest, I believe this is one of the biggest reasons why this company moves faster than other companies with equivalent size.- Most of work in Facebook reaches great amount of people (1.5B in web, 1.3B in mobile), and great amount of revenue (20B of this year). So you can tell how much impact you can have, and this would to the minimum becomes a highlighting bullet point on your resume.- People says Facebook has bad work/life balance, I don't agree: 1) you have freedom to pick a laid-back team and free to go almost anytime (they have hackamonth program and it is true), 2) most of time I see hardworking people working hard due to their own choice.","- People says Facebook has less politics, but I do feel some.

FB 15 is real- we've all gained 15 pounds in the first year!Very human in how they think of their employees- it's hard to find a company in the valley that treats their greatest assets with kindness and compassion.People genuinely care about each other","-you have to open your personal FB page up to co-workers (hard!)- makes sense that you use the product your company makes, but it's such a co-mingling of personal and professional lives.- there seems to be a group of the before and afters- who struggle to understand the company has grown and will not go back to the first 100 employees! This leads to a sense of entitlement and not playing as a team.- commute. UGH-Need to do better with giving back (as a company and as employees). I know our CEO has donated gazillions- but we need programs that allow employees to donate and have funds matched, and allow employees to volunteer their time.-More focus now that it's a larger company with 10K employees, on career growth and development.Opportunity to do on diversity hiring and older workers- the average age has to be under 25!And a more diverse executive team...","Keep things transparent- build strong leadership so we can focus on more than one crisis at a time- bring in senior leaders w/lots of experience who've gone through the lifecycle of a company before."
"5.0","""Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World""","Current Employee - Anonymous Employee","Menlo Park, CA","2015-10-05","I have been working at Facebook full-time (More than a year)","RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEO","If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are. The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.-Unbelievable benefits and compensation. Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing. Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on.- Strong company culture and values. I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely. Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"". Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here.-Work/life balance. You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here. I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.-Facilities. It's Facebook! The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors. Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.-Efficient and fast. Fewer politics than many other companies of this size. A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.-The future! These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff. Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.-Women's leadership. I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams). They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering. They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement. After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled. I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (""feedback is a gift"") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups.-That commute. If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day. The good news: that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible. You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own. Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read.","As you grow, you'll be tempted to cut back spending on benefits-- don't. That is one of Facebook's biggest differentiators and it seriously makes many of us question leaving."

They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment.If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong.","Puleeeze - do you really think management is listening?

You work hard, the pace is fast, expectations are high, and change is constant, but Facebook really looks after its employees and provides a diverse array of opportunities for self development, cross-functional training and career growth. The CEO meets with all employees once a week and answers anyone's questions.Most people here are energetic and passionate about their work and seriously focused on making an impact. The work environment is physically (and culturally) very open: open spaces, no offices, casual dress, etc. Work/life balance is respected and encouraged and you have the flexibility to work in the way that best matches your individual style and needs. Face-to-face communication is highly valued but meetings are generally focused on not time-wasting activities. Anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen. There is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers. The compensation, benefits and perks are truly above par.One of the most important things for me is the open culture and the way Facebook encourages employees to find and be our authentic selves, and to listen to the voices of others who may be different from ourselves. The company works very hard to create a diverse and welcoming environment for all.","It may be hard to adjust in the first few months if you're used to working in a traditional company.

Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that.In advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption.Having come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company.Management and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here.As a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.","You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success.

All of these companies offer basically the same thing: great engineers, good money, free food, impacting zillions of people and interesting tech problems. Facebook has a few things that set it apart:1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams.I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here.The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever.","With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore.Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch).Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me. I'm giving it a 5 because I think it's good for your life, not because I agree with that balance.","I wish the PR team was more proactive rather than reactive. I understand how press cycles work, but Facebook does try to do the right thing and constantly gets skewered. I think shaking this team up a bit would help."

FB has its eye on the ball at all times for its core platform yet is always looking at other opportunities for growth, though they may take several years to bear fruit. Management is open and accessible, particularly the weekly Q&A's with MZ and the leadership team - I've never experienced senior executives sharing that much information with an entire company before. Colleagues are easy to work with - not a lot of ego or politics that I've seen. In fact, we are reminded to check our ego as we enter the building - there is a lot of cooperation here.The benefits & perks are really amazing - I don't think college hires or interns truly appreciate what is offered here unless they have worked for other employers. (You can never take these things for granted, so I really appreciate these perks.) And the total compensation structure seems very competitive - they have many dials and buttons to play with, and I feel I am well-compensated for my contributions.The commute benefits are excellent, and make it really easy to use transit, shuttles or vanpools. Driving to work is just so stressful, both ways. I'd really rather not.","Long hours away from home, due to my own commute situation and long working hours.

The pay is great, the benefits are awesome, you are largely treated well, but this is a company you can definitely bite into too hard and overwork yourself.

By this I mean, allow a manager to focus on managing most of the time if it's right for the role. While its admirable that managers always need to work as well, not being graded on managerial skills creates unnecessary employee relations issues. At any other place, the manager can be one of the most critical advocates to a worker's career. Facebook is the only place I've ever been at where we can really have our managers bring out the best in folks and focus only on that role since the hierarchy is pretty flat.

Where else does your code impact a billion people? The compensation is amazing.Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate.","The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site.","Start selecting people for human relationship skills and focus less on pure technical ability."

Even on mobile apps, your code ships fast.Facebook's onboarding process is the best I've ever seen, and I've worked at a lot of other major companies. You're hired as an engineer, not as someone to fill a specific job. Then you spend your first six weeks getting to know how all of the company works, filling in small holes on code bases that you aren't familiar with (web, Android, iOS, data analysis stuff), and learning what problems in the company you most want to work on, before you pick your team. Every large software company should be doing this.","They do claim ownership of code you write outside of work, unless you run it by legal first.","Don't ever get rid of Boot Camp.

Engineers are always free to solve problems when they see them. Generally there are no hard deadlines to meet, so you can almost always put something to the side when you think there's something more valuable to do. If you find a bug in somebody else's project, fix it. If you have an idea for a useful feature, make it. We're willing to try anything once. The agility of Facebook is amazing, because all engineers are expected to be able to help out with anything. The org is very loose.And the benefits are fantastic.

Projects are run by PMs who really know what they are doing with a strong skill set in strategy, engineering, data driven decision making and user experience.Strategic direction - Money truly is a means by which we can achieve the mission to connect the world. There are tons of bold bets and we seem to have a good balance of reacting to the marketplace and maintaining focus on executing with blinders when necessary.Opportunity - There is so much work for really anyone to come in and make. With such rapid growth, there are bound to be mega bugs or missed opportunities ripe for fresh eyes to come in and recognize immediately.Culture - The company values are genuine and you really do get the feel that you are working on something bigger than yourself. Getting to hear from and ask questions of Mark each week really helps makes sure everyone is in the loop and feels heard if they disagree. You are never ""out of line"" for thinking big picture or questioning strategic direction and it is in fact encouraged. There's also a ton of young people so it is great to meet friends, especially if you live in SF.","Time - There are amazing perks like really quality free food all the time, a gym on campus with a basketball court and large playing field, shuttles to SF and surrounding areas but I often find my coworkers and I spend less time on that fun stuff that you might expect. There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.Company maturity - Like all fast growing companies, there is a natural curiosity around ""how much better would things be for me if I had joined earlier?"" because there would have been ever more responsibility and financial potential. Both of those things are still really high but it does raise the natural question of it would make sense to gain the skill sets to understand what makes Facebook work and then consider working somewhere smaller with more financial upside.","I had high expectations for the company management and they have far exceeded them.

Talented engineers create inventive tools that enable non-technical staff to do their jobs with ease. Genuinely nice and honest people can be found in every team.","From what I've seen in my time on multiple teams here, managers come in from different companies, take over teams, hire their own friends primarily from their previous companies, and then give the promotions to those people in a very short time. You may spend years hearing praise for the work you do, but it's never backed up with promotions. Also, this is not a good place to work if you are at all introverted, value family life more than work life, or prefer to work a normal person's schedule. If you are in a non-technical role, you also have little chance of seeing any kind of career advancement. Large divide in pay between people on the same teams and little transparency into the payment and growth processes.Additionally, most employees share a highly liberal political stance, which drives the culture in a mostly positive way, but it also requires that everyone agrees with the mindset. Those that have differing values can expect to feel ostracized.Finally, the treatment of vendors and contractors (including facilities staff, janitors, kitchen staff, security guards, and receptionists, among others) by employees can be staggeringly disappointing, embarrassing, and offensive. There is so much of a sense of entitlement upon employees that many seem to view others as second-class citizens.","Recognize people for their hard work more than how close of friends they are with you.

Almost all of them are very, very good. Down to about the 20th percentile of engineer, you can pretty much take their word as gold: if they say they'll do X in time Y, they will, and often a better X in a little less time than Y. This is a kind of super-power: it reduces the overhead of coordinating complex projects significantly.Facebook is also a mission-focused organization, in the same sense that the military, or a relief agency is. Most employees understand the goal of the company to be larger than just making its employees and shareholders materially successful.You will enjoy a vertiginous amount of authority as a front-line employee at Facebook. For better and for worse, on your first day at Facebook, you're given the keys to the proverbial Ferrari; you can push code, fix bugs, implement features, and yes, crash the site as much as any other engineer. Many user-facing decisions end up getting made by individual engineers.This also implies that your work will have impact. Almost everyone you meet in your daily life is a user of your software. If they are unhappy users, it is your fault and responsibility to make it better. If they are happy users, you can enjoy your share of the credit.All the basics (salary, equity, career advancement, food, miscellaneous perks like shuttles from SF) are world-class as well.","A mission-oriented job is not for everybody. If you are looking for a paycheck, and a ton of time to pursue your model railroading hobby, Facebook is going to be a weird fit for you. This is not to say that people don't have hobbies, or that everybody works 70 hrs/wk; but if you are completely ""checked out"" from your job, this will not be a happy place for you, not matter how good you are at it.The physical work environment (open plan office, graffiti on the walls, lots of free-form discussion and collaboration) can be jarring if you're coming from a more typical corporate engineering environment.",""

They want you to drink the KoolAid, versus have a constructive discussion.- In my group, promotions were given to unqualified people simply because they were buddies with the manager.

That doesn't sound too terrible, until you realize the massive workload given to each employee.","- Promote from within, create more transparency with promotions- Encourage employees to use their PTO - we work hard, we need to recharge.- Encourage employees to speak up and question product design or policies.

Many projects get delayed because they ask for random changes.- Working on backend teams doesn't have that problem, but they are typically second-class citizens and don't get as much respect as frontend teams.- Facebook is very large now and the bureacracy is starting to accumulate quickly. It used to be that engineers could just do stuff, but now almost every change requires a great deal of pointless discussion or overhead. For instance, you now have to fill out a form just to log some data.- Very strong focus on some of the ""hot"" product teams means that the rest of the company doesn't get preference with respect to product managers, designers, etc.- Most frontend work is boring mundane PHP. The only challenge comes from poorly-designed legacy systems.- Managers will often ask you to work on something you don't care about just because it's a priority for the company.

You won't be confined to your own team, which is nice. Overall, it's definitely the best job I've had so far.","As a pretty young company, policies and best practices change quite often, which can be hard to follow at times. Other than that, there really aren't many cons.","Keep meetings when you schedule them because it's hard for everyone else to change their schedules last minute and a lot of time is wasted."

"5.0","""Excellent plate to work""","Current Employee - Site Reliability Engineer","Mountain View, CA","2010-06-17","","RecommendsApproves of CEO","Amazing environment with a strong focus on getting things done vs politics or ""Process"". When bad things happen, the focus is always on finding a fix rather than finding the blame. Organized chaos. Working with some of the smartest and most knowledgeable people I've ever met. They don't just throw money away, but they're willing to spend to solve problems or improve things when it's needed. The benefits like free food are excellent, and in general they treat their employees like human adults instead of children or replaceable cogs or numbers.","The biggest downside is the organized chaos (although that's also a plus). At times it can be a bit too chaotic, though even that's improving.","What you're doing is working - keep at it. Although some increase in Process and bureaucracy is inevitable as the company grows, make sure that the focus on people never goes away. The risk of following ""Best Practices"" down the road to mediocrity is very real, and it will take away everything that makes the company great."

And that is what happens at Facebook. But then again, that is the growing pains that Facebook is going through. Also most of the innovative products have been implemented and a lot of focus now is on maintenance and tweaking.

Management process is also great - very hands off, lots of freedom to the engineers to work on what they are interested in, make important decisions. Lots of trust and responsibility in engineers.","It is starting to get a little big, and a little bit political, although I don't have much first hand experience with the politics. Split into multiple buildings again.","Management should work actively to try to discourage politics.

They get you in the door with the ""potential"" of going IPO but your in you give up your life and soul with little career growth or monetary incentives. Its no wonder that three of the four founders have already left in less than 3 years and long term employees are looking to sell their shares. No potential of any amount of 'potential' earnings once they go IPO is worth being treated like second class citizens or just a fancier sweat shop.","Don't be afraid to higher some more seasoned and senior talent for leadership and management positions who can help create structure, processes and tools to help the organization grow and scale with the demand. Sooner or later the lack of these seasoned managers will be what drives profitability down and decrease the potential Facebook has to be come a fortune 500 company."

We play basketball every week, have free beer on Friday and get to ripstick around the office. We even have games rooms and a ping pong table! The people who work here are incredibly high caliber individuals. The recruiting process is tough!","Some of the younger folks here (and there are many) have never worked anywhere else and they have no idea how good the place is.

All my friends and family use the product and it's rewarding to work on something that keeps us all connected.* Amazing food. We get breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner served up by the best chefs around. Menus change daily and my favorite to date has been the Willy Wonka themed lunch menu. Sushi day is legit too.* Flexible work schedules. 9 to 5 is dead, work the times that best work for you and your job.* Fun (Game Day, random toga party, RipStiks, cool people, etc.)","There's some growing pains because of the fast company growth and the office can get a bit noisy at times. My last job was at Google and I have to say that facebook is a far better place to work.","Keep being open and transparent to employees.

It's just great to know that if you're not feeling well but not necessarily ""too sick to work"" you can stay home and work (they provide laptops)....oh and...sick days are not counted against your vacation if you really needed to take a real sick day anyhow.","Because of the work from home policy, you do find yourself basically working all the time in a way. Some say it's a downside, I personally loved it! As long as I got my work done my boss didn't care how much I was actually in the office. However, I do have to say, that I did NOT abuse this. I really only worked from home when I absolutely needed to. I'd say out of a year I probably worked from home maybe about 2wks worth.","Develop a fair company-wide bonus structure where all employees can work towards and feel rewarded for accomplishments. A review process is also needed, but one that actually results in employer/employee feedback and raise/bonus."

You really learn a lot, since you get thrown into the mix quite quickly.
